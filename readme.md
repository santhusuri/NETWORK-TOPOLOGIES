# üåê Network Topology Simulations

This repository contains **various network topologies** implemented and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
Each folder represents a specific topology with configurations, screenshots, and explanations.

## üîÄ Topologies Covered

### 1. **Bus Topology**
- All devices connected to a single backbone cable.
- Simple but not scalable.

### 2. **Ring Topology**
- Devices connected in a circular manner.
- Data travels in one direction (or both, in dual-ring).

### 3. **Star Topology**
- Central switch/hub connects all devices.
- Scalable and easy to manage.

### 4. **Mesh Topology**
- Devices are interconnected (Full Mesh or Partial Mesh).
- Provides redundancy and fault tolerance.

### 5. **Tree Topology**
- Hierarchical structure (like an inverted tree).
- Combines features of star and bus topologies.

### 6. **Hybrid Topology**
- Combination of two or more topologies (e.g., Star + Mesh).
- Commonly used in enterprise networks for scalability & redundancy.
